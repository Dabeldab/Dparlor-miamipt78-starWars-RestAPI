# Dparlor - Star Wars REST API

Welcome to the Dparlor Star Wars REST API project! This API provides a comprehensive interface to access various data related to the Star Wars universe. It is designed to help you enhance your coding skills while working with RESTful services.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to increase your coding ability and knowledge by providing a hands-on experience with REST APIs. You will learn how to create, manage, and consume APIs effectively.

## Features

- Access to various Star Wars entities such as characters, planets, starships, and vehicles.
- RESTful API endpoints to retrieve, create, update, and delete data.
- Easy-to-use and well-documented API structure.
- Built with modern web technologies for better understanding and learning.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Dparlor Star Wars REST API, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dabeldab/Dparlor-miamipt78-starWars-RestAPI.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Dparlor-miamipt78-starWars-RestAPI
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
